I'm Kevin, a software engineer currently pursuing a B.S in Computer Science from UC Berkeley.
In the past, I've interned with ConsenSys Systems, a Brooklyn based blockchain development studio.
My current interests include Go(language and board game), AI/machine learning, and Android development.

At Berkeley, I've finished taking Discrete Math, Data Structures, and Computer Architecture.
I am currently enrolled in upper-div Algorithms, Intro to AI, and UI/UX design.

Outside of class I compete on the university fencing team, enjoy reading science fiction novels, and train in powerlifting.
